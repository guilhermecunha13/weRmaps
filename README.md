<b>Our Goals</b>
```
Ours primary intention are a quite not really humble :)
- build, 
- apply in real Brasilian data, 
- and distribute a set of tools intended to 
- mine (discover), 
- download, 
- share, 
- transform (change data formats), 
- analyse data and 
- visualize geo-social-data which was/were intended originally or was 
- primarily conceived and 
- collected to be treated as or to be, in any meningfull way, -
- considered as geographic data
- or by being presentend in any "mapped" makes it better to undesrstand and to be  in order to make sense.
```
The state-of-thea-art for statistical analysis tool 'R' (http://cran.r-project.org/) is intended to be the used 
as the front line programming language, but there is any limit nor any commitment with one tool ore 
another a priori. 
There are lots of of "hammer" donne in 
- R (http://cran.r-project.org/)
- python(www.python.org), http://matplotlib.org/)
- ipython(www.ipython.org),  
- octave (www.gnu.org/software/octave/), 
- C (http:gcc.gnu.org, http://llvm.org/), 
- Ruby (https://www.ruby-lang.org/), 
- Erlang (www.erlang.org),
- Haskell (http://www.haskell.org/haskellwiki/Haskell),
- PHP (php.net),
- JS (There is a huge amount of libs and frameworks writing in JS, such as noSQL-data-storage-solutions (amongst them, of of js and noSQL sol. and how to´s out there, but node.js
Node.js and MongoDB -- nodejs.org, mongodb.org had caught me)
- of course HTML5+CC3+JS (www.w3c)
- Ok, there´s Java alsoo :-)
- and so on, and on ... 
- and, if needed and you are licensed: Mathematica (for who uses it and loves it, dont miss a thorough look into ipython!) 
- so, get the job defined and
- lets shall use the most suited hammer to each to just to <b>get the job done</b>
